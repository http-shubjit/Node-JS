//** the basic diffrence between sql database and mongo database is , in sql we can store data in the form of relational format(table-row and column) but in case of mongo db we can store data in the form of BSON (binary json format)

//**MongoDB	MySQL, supports unstructured data	and SQL, supports structured data with schemas

//**in case of mongo db Limited document querying, no support for joins	but in SQL db for querying and advanced analytics functions


//** Architecture:

1.collection in mongo database- it is like a table in sql database 
2.inside a collection there is document 

ex:
collectionuser >
{
  document-1
}
{
  document-2
}


//**use
install and set the enviornmental path , then open terminal and start type "mongosh"


//**command
>show dbs:show all databases
>use <db name>:for using the db
>show collection:show all collections in that db
>db.collectionname.find({}):showing all document
>db.collectionname.insert({}):inser data
